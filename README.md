Project Idea: Student Information System (SIS)
Overview
The Student Information System (SIS) is designed to manage student data and facilitate communication between students and teachers. The system provides features for course enrollment, teacher assignment, and course management.

# **How it Works**
User Registration: Students register for the system, providing basic information such as username, name, address, and desired courses.
__Teacher Assignment:__ Upon registration, students are assigned to teachers based on the courses they choose. If no teacher is available for a particular course, the student will remain unassigned until a teacher registers for that course.
**Course Enrollment:** Students can enroll in courses from a selection of 23 available courses. The system ensures that students are only assigned to courses for which a teacher is available.
**Teacher Registration:** Teachers register for the system, providing their credentials and indicating the courses they are qualified to teach.
**Course Management:** Teachers can manage enrolled students, track student progress, and communicate with students through the system.
**Responsive Design:** The system is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.
# **Technologies Used**
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Backend:** PHP, MySQL
